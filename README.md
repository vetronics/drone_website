# Drone Website üöÅ

Welcome to the **Drone Website** repository! This project is a static website that showcases the different uses and ethical considerations of drones, both in **military** and **civilian** contexts. The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a **C++ script** that generates dynamic content. The website is structured with clear sections to cover the history, ethical implications, and various use cases of drones.

## Overview of the Website üåç

The website is organized into several key sections:

- **Military Use**: Discusses how drones are utilized in military applications.
- **Civilian Use**: Explains the civilian applications of drones, including delivery services, agriculture, and more.
- **Ethics**: Addresses the ethical considerations surrounding drone use, particularly in military and surveillance contexts.
- **Conclusions**: Summarizes the information provided and reflects on the future of drone technology.
- **History**: Provides a historical overview of drone development and its evolution.

## Project Structure üìÅ

The project structure is organized into folders and files as follows:


### Main Sections Explained üìë

- **Military Use**: 
  The section dedicated to the **military use of drones** explains how drones are employed for surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeted strikes. It also addresses the controversial use of drones in warfare and surveillance of civilian populations.

- **Civilian Use**: 
  This section highlights **civilian applications of drones**. Examples include:
  - **Delivery**: Drones used for delivering packages, particularly in remote areas.
  - **Agriculture**: Drones are used to monitor crops, assess health, and even assist in crop dusting.
  - **Photography and Filmmaking**: Drones have revolutionized aerial photography and filmmaking with affordable, high-quality footage.

- **Ethics**: 
  The ethical implications of drone usage are explored, including concerns about privacy invasion, surveillance, and their use in military combat. This section raises important questions about the regulation and accountability of drone usage, especially when used in conflict zones.

- **Conclusions**: 
  The conclusion section reflects on the content provided in the website, discussing the future of drone technology, the balance between military and civilian use, and the ethical responsibilities associated with their development and deployment.

- **History**: 
  The **history of drones** provides an overview of how drone technology has evolved over the years. From its origins in military applications to the current widespread civilian use, this section traces the development of drones from their inception to today‚Äôs advanced, multi-purpose devices.

## C++ Script for Dynamic Content

The project includes a **C++ script** located in `project_drone/html_file_creation_scripts/`. This script generates dynamic content for the site, which is later included in the HTML pages. The script can be easily extended to generate additional content or update existing information.

## How to Set Up the Project Locally üîß

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

To run this project locally, ensure you have:
- A **C++ Compiler** (such as GCC or Clang) to compile and run the C++ script.
